CS 4223 – Preliminary Grammar for the Compiler

P ::= program D begin S end.

D ::= IL : AR D | IL : integer D | ∈

AR ::= array | array(AR)

IL ::= ID IL | , ID IL | ∈

ID ::= id | id(SB)

SB ::= cons SB | id SB | , cons SB | , id SB | ∈

S ::=  do S unless C | S when C | S when C else S | (IL)in | (IL)out | assign E to ID |
	S ; S

E ::= id | cons | + E E | - E E | * E E |  / E E

C ::= < E E | > E E | = E E | and C C | or C C | not C


Format:
1.  Source lines are 80 characters in length and tokens may appear anywhere in the line.
2.  A token may not be broken across line boundaries.
3.  A comment is any sequence of characters beginning with /* and ending with */
4.  Tokens for reserved words must be separated from one another by at least one blank (but perhaps more than one blank).
5.  Upper and lowercase characters are equivalent.
6.  Spaces and symbols are delimiters.
